# Working with Messy Data in OpenRefine

Description:In an ideal world, any data you collect or obtain would be clean and formatted perfectly for analysis and visualization. But the reality is that data can be really messy! Cleaning and reformatting your data can be a time-consuming and tedious task, but there are ways to speed things up and automate repetitive tasks. OpenRefine can help

## To-Do
- Explore and identify patterns in data
- Normalize data using facets and clusters
- Manipulate and generate new textual and numeric data
- Transform and reshape datasets
