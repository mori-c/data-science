I learned how to code and model in R which I've had fears about and how to use GitHub  ","no","Yes","5"
"2017/12/05 3:01:30 PM EST","4","Pacing can be slower (I was someone who had limited experience to R); Population modelling could have also had a deeper math background; I did not use math for a long time. ","2","4","In rare cases, the pacing was too fast.","4","Class needs more experience with GitHub; possibly a workshop on creating Methods/Results/Discussion. ","Use of a coding language to do the project and create the manuscript.","4","4","3","More background knowledge on GitHub; more background in math for the population model section.","Getting solid experience in using R","The use of R as a tool to explore data","Greater in-depth understanding of creating statistical models in R (maybe cover mixed-models, etc.)","Yes","4"
"2017/12/05 3:02:30 PM EST","4","Challenges were really helpful, and practical. More time spent on modelling would have been helpful, as it was the hardest part of the course. ","3","4","Some of the online course notes did not have the same amount of detain as was covered in lecture, specifically for the lectures on Git and terminal use. ","4","A bit more guidance could be helpful for the final project. Additionally, by covering more modeling methods in lecture, more would be available for use on the final project. ","A big difference was that a large amount of class time was spent on the project. In other classes all work was done outside of class. Additionally a lot of help was provided by the instructors for the final project, and this was very helpful. ","4","4","3","More time spent on the ecological aspect of the models would have been beneficial. ","The course has provided me the knowledge of using R that I can then apply to other classes and my own research. This has been extremely helpful.

"2017/12/05 3:06:14 PM EST","4","Solutions to challenges could be more emphasized. When we tried the challenges on our own, it made the areas we didn't understand more clear, and if the solutions were explained more slowly and clearly, it would have helped to clear up the things we didn't understand.","3","4","Not much. Pacing was good and explanations were generally super clear. If anything, a few extra questions/challenges beyond the lecture and the assignments would be helpful for getting more comfortable with tricky concepts.","4","Git should have been emphasized more in the lectures, since it is such an integral part of the project. A lot of our time was spent trying to figure out the different git commands and move files to and from github.","The final project is a super cool idea, and it's totally unlike any other undergrad project. The biggest differences were how open-ended it was and the fact that we were able to use real data. Both of these things made it much easier to invest myself in the project, because it felt like I was actually doing something cool and practical, not just doing a project for the sake of marks.","4","5","4","A few practice questions/challenges posted after each lecture to help reinforce the concepts at home.","The instruction was always easy to follow, and it made learning R a lot less intimidating than I figured it would be. Being able to develop a good basic understanding of R in such a chill atmosphere was awesome.","Beyond the basic R instruction, which was by far better than any other course I've taken involving R, the lectures on modelling and interpretation of data were very relevant. No other course I've taken has gone into this level of detail regarding how to handle a dataset.","I initially just hoped to come out of this course with a basic understanding of how to use R, so the fact that we learned so much about data manipulation and analysis was super exciting. I definitely learned a lot more than I was expecting to.","Yes","4"
"2017/12/05 3:06:39 PM EST","4","probably more ecological content will be better, after all this is an EEB course. :p","2","5","instructors are doing very well in general, some may need to work on the pace, most are great.","4","when we are doing the research, I realized there are some models that I have never heard, and strongly biologically related models, I'm very looking forward to hear some of that in class which will be super useful for final prospects and even for future. but I assume most instructors don't know those as well.","more cooperative I think, we are met at least twice (in class) each class, which is great. ","4","4","2","as mentioned before, I hope there are someone in the teaching group that is actually familiar with some ecological/biological models","lot of fun, learning basic R and doing challenge is very interesting, assignment as well, not very stressful and well-designed.","Even in the statistic course, they are not teaching R in this mush details. But in my opinion, we definitely need guides to know how to use R, I think this is great.","as mentioned before, more biological/ecological specific models.","Yes","5"
"2017/12/05 3:09:02 PM EST","5","I think the course content could be improved if more information on modelling was included. Having more practice on how to apply different models to different datasets would help us be more prepared for the project. But overall, I think the course had an excellent structure. The fact that we started with the very basics, and then progressively moved forward  toward more complicated stuff was definitely appreciated! ","3","5","I think everything was great, given that each of the instructors came with their expertise, which made the learning project very enjoyable. ","4","I think the expectations for the final project were outlined well, and therefore I don't think there could be anything from the instructors' side to make the project better. ","In this class we definitely got more guidance, and that was helpful. Also, having time in class to work on a project is not what usually happens in other classes, but it is very useful. ","4","5","3","I think spending more time covering various models, understanding differences between them would help to improve the course. ","I enjoyed learning the skills that actually have an application, compared to just learning theory. ","Working with data; working in a group; coding ","I personally would benefit from learning more statistics in R. But also I feel like with the skills I got from this class, I can actually teach myself what I need, given that the basics are already there. So thank you! ","Yes","5"
"2017/12/05 3:16:46 PM EST","5","The lesson on ggplot2 should have been introduced earlier in the course. By the time that lesson was taught, I felt that most of us already knew how to do most of the coding for graphs. I also think a lecture on mixed effects modelling could have been incorporated since this seemed to be a big part of both projects. Finally, a more comprehensive tutorial on on git would have been really useful on the course website (as was done for R). When I tried reviewing the material on git at home I did not find this particularly useful because the terms were all new to me. ","3","5","In general instructors were excellent. I liked that they made themselves available before and after class and took the time to answer our questions etc. ","4","Again, a lecture on mixed effects models would have been useful. I felt that my group spent too much time trying to figure out what this model did. Learning about this model would have saved a lot of time. ","Previous group projects mostly involved doing a review of the literature to answer a scientific questions, whereas this one involved actively doing the analysis (like an independent research project). ","4","5","5","I think this course would benefit from being a separate R course, as opposed to a theoretical ecology course. More students would enrol in R, which I think is a good skill to learn. And I think this could act as a complementary course to theoretical ecology where you might be learning more ecological concepts as opposed to basic R coding. ","I enjoyed the group project most. It gave me the opportunity to test my knowledge of R on real data, and provided me with the experience of how a scientist might use a program like R to answer certain questions.","Skills using R. this was previously taught to us in a second year stats course but it wasn't a really in depth instruction of what we were actually doing on the program. I liked that this course provided me with ","I expected to learn more population concepts. A lot of time was spent learning how to *use* R which is good but I think incorporating concepts from population ecology would have fulfilled the name of the course. ","Yes","5"
