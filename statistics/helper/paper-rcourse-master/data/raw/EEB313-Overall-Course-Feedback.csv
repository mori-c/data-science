Made the class a lot more bearable then i thought it would be","It helped a lot with my statistical thinking, often in stats class i find we don't apply things directly to data sets its rather repeat questions and just answering questions in a pattern.

","Yes, my R skills and how to apply statistical knowledge to biological concept.","No, I have learned everything that I want to know.","Yes","5"
"2018/12/04 5:38:25 PM EST","4","Personally, more explanation behind the statistics might have been better. I feel like a lot of people in EEB have a weak background in stats so really explaining the basics is never a bad thing. It also seemed to go from pretty basic intro to R and ggplot in Ahmed's section to like crazy stats and coding in the next section. Maybe a more gradual introduction to the next concepts? But the content covered throughout the course was good.","3","5","I really liked that challenges that were done in the beginning of the course, maybe this can be incorporated into more lectures?","4","A better introduction to Github! Maybe instead of doing just an example of how to use GitBash have some homework the week before and have everything set up so people can actually create a folder and directory that they will use for their project.","Using github and the making sure the code was reproducible. It requires a lot more communication than just creating a presentation for a paper.","4","5","3","Nothing more than what I've mentioned above.","That all the lecturers were really open about using our own data and helping us with other projects! And honestly, I would literally learn a concept in class and then have a lab meeting with my supervisor and they'd tell me that my next analysis would be something that we just covered in class. SO helpful. I guess I mean that it was a really good, broad, useful introduction to coding that I sorely needed. I've been trying to learn this independently/ through other courses and this is the first thing that's really stuck.","Its hard to compare this course to other courses because most courses are rote memorization, while this one basically teaches you a new language. I guess I'd say critical thinking? You really need to learn how to word the code in a way that will produce the results you want.","No.","Yes","5"
"2018/12/04 5:40:34 PM EST","3","Everything was pretty great. I wish the project was more structured in that we had to meet with the TAs and communicate our firm plan by a certain deadline. This would have led to less of a scramble towards the end as we were having a lot of fun running exploratory data analysis and then realized we were running out of time.","3","5","Some would benefit from speaking a bit louder","3","Deadlines for having to communicate idea and approach to TAs. More 1 on 1 required meetings with the TAs.

I learned so much my brain hurt sometimes","Statistical skills. I feel like I learned more in this course than in my entire semester of real biostatistics.","It would be really cool to do some work with landscape data in R.","Yes","5"
"2018/12/04 5:42:06 PM EST","5","I loved the course, I think the pacing and structure were perfect - I think that  a bit more of the statistical theory behind what we are doing would be awesome, but overall it was good. I think that also spending more time going over how to do simulations in R would be incredibly useful as well (i.e. simulating SIR models etc.) ","3","5","I think that spending more time on student questions would be useful. Office hours were useful but it wasn't clear prior to the class that office hours were only after the Tuesday lectures, and so for students who couldn't hang around, it was hard to get time to ask for help with questions. ","3","I think that perhaps narrowing the scope of the final project could be useful - it was a very open ended question, and while that could be good in some cases, having a more directed set of questions could be useful. I also think that while the weekly checkups were useful and that the instructors were definitely available to ask questions to, having it a bit more structured such that each group had to explicitly sit down with their instructors every week (even just for 5 minutes) and go over where they are, and ask questions would be super useful, especially just from the perspective of 'is the question we're asking good,  and is the analysis we're using correct?' and then getting specific feedback on that for just a few minutes each class that was spent on the project. ","It was much more free-form, there was much less direction in terms of where to go with the analysis etc., and the expectations as far as the complexity of the analysis required were somewhat vague. ","4","5","4","I think having the high number of instructors present every week is totally awesome, so please don't change that! I think slightly more direction with the project, and perhaps more background on the actual statistics could be useful (even if it means more reading/work outside of class time)!","I enjoyed the interactive, do-it-in-real-time nature of the course, I loved that the instructors were grad students not profs so it felt less intimidating, and I loved that the course was small, so you kind of felt like you got to know the instructors a bit over the time. ","Any other course I've taken or am currently taking ONLY worked in base R, whereas this course obviously taught in tidyR which I think is FAR superior, so that was super useful, thank you!!!","I did expect a bit more on simulating data and simulating models, but that wasn't a bit deal. ","Yes","5"
"2018/12/04 6:01:53 PM EST","5","Pacing was slightly fast at first (in Ahmed’s section) as there was a learning curve when first working with R. Content and concepts were all super useful for other classes! Challenges were a great way to make sure I’m still paying attention ","3","5","Instructors were great! TAs were approachable and responded fast to emails and were always available for questions. ","4","Maybe a bit more clarification with git. Would’ve preferred if TAs really encouraged using R throughout the project because we started using it and then it sort of faded into the background as we fell back to using Google Docs and sharing files through file transfer. ","It was a little hard to get right into it since the project was so broad, in comparison to other courses that are very specialized. However, once we decided on a topic (all of us were open to any ideas, which made it hard), we were able to dive right in and be productive. ","5","5","4","Let students know when specific TAs are going to be in class or not since TAs all have different specialities and sometimes we need a specific question answered by a specific TA. ","Understanding how to use R without copying code directly. ","Everything R related!!! Other classes didn’t even teach me half of what I learned in the first class. ","I would’ve enjoyed more modelling and making pretty graphs. Sometimes those topics were glossed over really quick. ","Yes","5"
"2018/12/04 6:40:15 PM EST","5","Reviewing concepts from statistics more thoroughly: especially knowing when to pick what test, checking assumptions, what kinds of statistics to report (confidence intervals, standard error, etc) ","3","5","The instructors were overall really knowledgeable and kind and open to questions, and I liked that they came from such different backgrounds of academia. They were great! ","5","I would have appreciated a better explanation of how to use github and command line git - it was covered really fast, and this is something I still have trouble with. ","I loved that we had so much (guided) freedom to choose topics, work collaboratively during class time, and apply everything we learned in lectures. Unlike some other undergraduate group projects, this project felt very relevant and important and like we were actually making discoveries (I think the class time we received to work on the project made it different) ","4","5","3","More emphasis on stats (but I'm biased): during the final project, I saw lots of students making lots of violations to the assumptions of regression and it made my heart break","The assignments! They were the perfect synthesis of everything we learned ","Problem solving***, creativity, critical thinking, figuring things out independently, collaboration ","Just more info about good practices of statistics","Yes","5"

I would prefer it the other way around.","5","4","4","Make sure the projector works lmao","Getting surprisingly good marks. I'm glad that everything was broken up into small assignments so that I could apply skills from each lecture.

"2018/12/07 10:31:47 PM EST","4","I think having more explanation for more challenging concepts would be useful. Maybe making the class more interactive would be beneficial, since sometimes it just felt that we were just copying down whatever code instructors were writing. ","3","4","Explanation of concepts - especially stats ones since a lot of people hadn't been exposed to stats in at least a year. ","4","More check ins - assign a TA to each group or so to ensure that all of our questions are being answered so we don't feel lost. ","There was definitely more structure in this project in terms of group dynamics (code of conduct, roles, meeting minutes). However I didn't particularly enjoy the open-endedness of the project itself. Usually my other projects involved a clear goal, but here we had to make it ourselves. I appreciate the experience, but it just was a little hard for me to adjust. ","3","3","2","Teach us how to use GitHub earlier!!! Also i think that it would be helpful for us to see all of the final project datasets at the start of the term, so we can start thinking about what we want to do earlier on, and as we learn skills through lectures we can apply them to our projects. ","I really enjoyed the lecture material! It was delivered pretty well, and the lecture notes were a good reference as well.  R definitely is not as scary as I thought it was. ","Logic.
