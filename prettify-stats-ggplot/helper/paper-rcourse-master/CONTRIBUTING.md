# Contributing to the paper (or papers) about the R course

Adding content to the repository:

1. Have your own fork or create a branch from the master `paper-rcourse` repo.
2. Work on a defined issue that was assigned to you or that you self-assigned.
3. Submit a PR specific to the issue to close it. If you are still working on it,
include `WIP:` in the title of your PR.
4. Write `Closes #issue_number` in the comment of your pull request if the PR
closes an issue.

Adding issues and dealing with labels, milestones, and assigning:

- Anyone can create an issue. Anyone can self-assign themselves to an issue.
- Only @lwjohnst86 and @mbonsma will manage labels, milestones, and projects, as 
well as assigning others to tasks.

Reviewing PR:

- Anyone can review or comment on any PR.
- We need at least one reviewer to approve a PR before it can be merged.
- All authors are responsible for commenting on and approving the PR with the final
version of the paper, before we submit to the journal.
