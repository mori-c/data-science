2017.0,2017-12-05,4,More challenges. Some of the GitHub stuff isn't on the online lectures which made it hard to remember what we learned.,3,4,Pacing,4,More in-depth outline of what is needed and more time to work on the project,"My group was easy to work with, the biggest difference is actually using R and GitHub",4,5,3,Make it a full year course and ask more ecological/biological questions during the assignment instead of just make this graph with a code we can copy off the lectures online,The feeling how actually learning something useful. I really like the finial project because it linked ecology and using R which I felt was lacking for the rest of the course.,Yes. I learned how to code and model in R which I've had fears about and how to use GitHub,no,Yes,5
2017.0,2017-12-05,4,Pacing can be slower (I was someone who had limited experience to R); Population modelling could have also had a deeper math background; I did not use math for a long time.,2,4,"In rare cases, the pacing was too fast.",4,Class needs more experience with GitHub; possibly a workshop on creating Methods/Results/Discussion.,Use of a coding language to do the project and create the manuscript.,4,4,3,More background knowledge on GitHub; more background in math for the population model section.,Getting solid experience in using R,The use of R as a tool to explore data,"Greater in-depth understanding of creating statistical models in R (maybe cover mixed-models, etc.)",Yes,4
2017.0,2017-12-05,4,"Challenges were really helpful, and practical. More time spent on modelling would have been helpful, as it was the hardest part of the course.",3,4,"Some of the online course notes did not have the same amount of detain as was covered in lecture, specifically for the lectures on Git and terminal use.",4,"A bit more guidance could be helpful for the final project. Additionally, by covering more modeling methods in lecture, more would be available for use on the final project.","A big difference was that a large amount of class time was spent on the project. In other classes all work was done outside of class. Additionally a lot of help was provided by the instructors for the final project, and this was very helpful.",4,4,3,More time spent on the ecological aspect of the models would have been beneficial.,The course has provided me the knowledge of using R that I can then apply to other classes and my own research. This has been extremely helpful.,"Again, learning how to use R in this course has been amazing, and very practical .",No,Yes,4
2017.0,2017-12-05,4,More practice using github,3,4,nothing. they are really good,4,More datasets would allow more options to choose,Manipulating the data into a form that was easy to understand and read,3,3,3,none,Everyone using R together because if you had a problem you could ask a neighbor,Coding in general.  I never used R before so I feel more confident looking at coding now,none,Yes,4
2017.0,2017-12-05,4,"Solutions to challenges could be more emphasized. When we tried the challenges on our own, it made the areas we didn't understand more clear, and if the solutions were explained more slowly and clearly, it would have helped to clear up the things we didn't understand.",3,4,"Not much. Pacing was good and explanations were generally super clear. If anything, a few extra questions/challenges beyond the lecture and the assignments would be helpful for getting more comfortable with tricky concepts.",4,"Git should have been emphasized more in the lectures, since it is such an integral part of the project. A lot of our time was spent trying to figure out the different git commands and move files to and from github.","The final project is a super cool idea, and it's totally unlike any other undergrad project. The biggest differences were how open-ended it was and the fact that we were able to use real data. Both of these things made it much easier to invest myself in the project, because it felt like I was actually doing something cool and practical, not just doing a project for the sake of marks.",4,5,4,A few practice questions/challenges posted after each lecture to help reinforce the concepts at home.,"The instruction was always easy to follow, and it made learning R a lot less intimidating than I figured it would be. Being able to develop a good basic understanding of R in such a chill atmosphere was awesome.","Beyond the basic R instruction, which was by far better than any other course I've taken involving R, the lectures on modelling and interpretation of data were very relevant. No other course I've taken has gone into this level of detail regarding how to handle a dataset.","I initially just hoped to come out of this course with a basic understanding of how to use R, so the fact that we learned so much about data manipulation and analysis was super exciting. I definitely learned a lot more than I was expecting to.",Yes,4
2017.0,2017-12-05,4,"probably more ecological content will be better, after all this is an EEB course. :p",2,5,"instructors are doing very well in general, some may need to work on the pace, most are great.",4,"when we are doing the research, I realized there are some models that I have never heard, and strongly biologically related models, I'm very looking forward to hear some of that in class which will be super useful for final prospects and even for future. but I assume most instructors don't know those as well.","more cooperative I think, we are met at least twice (in class) each class, which is great.",4,4,2,"as mentioned before, I hope there are someone in the teaching group that is actually familiar with some ecological/biological models","lot of fun, learning basic R and doing challenge is very interesting, assignment as well, not very stressful and well-designed.","Even in the statistic course, they are not teaching R in this mush details. But in my opinion, we definitely need guides to know how to use R, I think this is great.","as mentioned before, more biological/ecological specific models.",Yes,5
2017.0,2017-12-05,5,"I think the course content could be improved if more information on modelling was included. Having more practice on how to apply different models to different datasets would help us be more prepared for the project. But overall, I think the course had an excellent structure. The fact that we started with the very basics, and then progressively moved forward  toward more complicated stuff was definitely appreciated!",3,5,"I think everything was great, given that each of the instructors came with their expertise, which made the learning project very enjoyable.",4,"I think the expectations for the final project were outlined well, and therefore I don't think there could be anything from the instructors' side to make the project better.","In this class we definitely got more guidance, and that was helpful. Also, having time in class to work on a project is not what usually happens in other classes, but it is very useful.",4,5,3,"I think spending more time covering various models, understanding differences between them would help to improve the course.","I enjoyed learning the skills that actually have an application, compared to just learning theory.",Working with data; working in a group; coding,"I personally would benefit from learning more statistics in R. But also I feel like with the skills I got from this class, I can actually teach myself what I need, given that the basics are already there. So thank you!",Yes,5
2017.0,2017-12-05,5,"The lesson on ggplot2 should have been introduced earlier in the course. By the time that lesson was taught, I felt that most of us already knew how to do most of the coding for graphs. I also think a lecture on mixed effects modelling could have been incorporated since this seemed to be a big part of both projects. Finally, a more comprehensive tutorial on on git would have been really useful on the course website (as was done for R). When I tried reviewing the material on git at home I did not find this particularly useful because the terms were all new to me.",3,5,In general instructors were excellent. I liked that they made themselves available before and after class and took the time to answer our questions etc.,4,"Again, a lecture on mixed effects models would have been useful. I felt that my group spent too much time trying to figure out what this model did. Learning about this model would have saved a lot of time.","Previous group projects mostly involved doing a review of the literature to answer a scientific questions, whereas this one involved actively doing the analysis (like an independent research project).",4,5,5,"I think this course would benefit from being a separate R course, as opposed to a theoretical ecology course. More students would enrol in R, which I think is a good skill to learn. And I think this could act as a complementary course to theoretical ecology where you might be learning more ecological concepts as opposed to basic R coding.","I enjoyed the group project most. It gave me the opportunity to test my knowledge of R on real data, and provided me with the experience of how a scientist might use a program like R to answer certain questions.",Skills using R. this was previously taught to us in a second year stats course but it wasn't a really in depth instruction of what we were actually doing on the program. I liked that this course provided me with,I expected to learn more population concepts. A lot of time was spent learning how to *use* R which is good but I think incorporating concepts from population ecology would have fulfilled the name of the course.,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,Take more time on challenging topics,3,5,Taking their time,5,N/A,It was a pick your own adventure style,5,5,3,Walk students through Github more in depth,Spread out and fair worl’oad,Coding,N/A,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,nothing,5,5,"Elaborating on lecture notes a little more, although very helpful and concise, sometimes when getting stuck on code during class i got frazzled and then couldn't take notes.",5,"It was great that we got to investigate anything we wanted, TAs were super helpful.","The ability to investigate topics you want,",5,5,5,TAs are super helpful!! Made the class a lot more bearable then i thought it would be,"It helped a lot with my statistical thinking, often in stats class i find we don't apply things directly to data sets its rather repeat questions and just answering questions in a pattern. The assignments were great because they made us utilize the code and then use that stats background to analyze.","Yes, this will help i believe tremendously in graduate school/research.",Nope,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,"If the content in one lecture could be decreased a little, it will be better.",3,5,The instructors are all awesome.,5,It will be helpful to have more lectures on how to use GitHub for the final project.,The final project is really opened up and does not have many limitations and gives us chance to work on anything that we have interests of.,5,5,4,The course size could be bigger. This is a wonderful course for students to take!,The course teaches a lot of R skills that is useful to a lot of different areas.,"Yes, my R skills and how to apply statistical knowledge to biological concept.","No, I have learned everything that I want to know.",Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,4,"Personally, more explanation behind the statistics might have been better. I feel like a lot of people in EEB have a weak background in stats so really explaining the basics is never a bad thing. It also seemed to go from pretty basic intro to R and ggplot in Ahmed's section to like crazy stats and coding in the next section. Maybe a more gradual introduction to the next concepts? But the content covered throughout the course was good.",3,5,"I really liked that challenges that were done in the beginning of the course, maybe this can be incorporated into more lectures?",4,A better introduction to Github! Maybe instead of doing just an example of how to use GitBash have some homework the week before and have everything set up so people can actually create a folder and directory that they will use for their project.,Using github and the making sure the code was reproducible. It requires a lot more communication than just creating a presentation for a paper.,4,5,3,Nothing more than what I've mentioned above.,"That all the lecturers were really open about using our own data and helping us with other projects! And honestly, I would literally learn a concept in class and then have a lab meeting with my supervisor and they'd tell me that my next analysis would be something that we just covered in class. SO helpful. I guess I mean that it was a really good, broad, useful introduction to coding that I sorely needed. I've been trying to learn this independently/ through other courses and this is the first thing that's really stuck.","Its hard to compare this course to other courses because most courses are rote memorization, while this one basically teaches you a new language. I guess I'd say critical thinking? You really need to learn how to word the code in a way that will produce the results you want.",No.,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,3,Everything was pretty great. I wish the project was more structured in that we had to meet with the TAs and communicate our firm plan by a certain deadline. This would have led to less of a scramble towards the end as we were having a lot of fun running exploratory data analysis and then realized we were running out of time.,3,5,Some would benefit from speaking a bit louder,3,Deadlines for having to communicate idea and approach to TAs. More 1 on 1 required meetings with the TAs. EVERY TA at the classes for group projects because sometimes the TA who knew what we tests we were running best was not present.,Github,4,5,4,Go over the assignments as a class after,R... I learned so much my brain hurt sometimes,Statistical skills. I feel like I learned more in this course than in my entire semester of real biostatistics.,It would be really cool to do some work with landscape data in R.,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,"I loved the course, I think the pacing and structure were perfect - I think that  a bit more of the statistical theory behind what we are doing would be awesome, but overall it was good. I think that also spending more time going over how to do simulations in R would be incredibly useful as well (i.e. simulating SIR models etc.)",3,5,"I think that spending more time on student questions would be useful. Office hours were useful but it wasn't clear prior to the class that office hours were only after the Tuesday lectures, and so for students who couldn't hang around, it was hard to get time to ask for help with questions.",3,"I think that perhaps narrowing the scope of the final project could be useful - it was a very open ended question, and while that could be good in some cases, having a more directed set of questions could be useful. I also think that while the weekly checkups were useful and that the instructors were definitely available to ask questions to, having it a bit more structured such that each group had to explicitly sit down with their instructors every week (even just for 5 minutes) and go over where they are, and ask questions would be super useful, especially just from the perspective of 'is the question we're asking good,  and is the analysis we're using correct?' and then getting specific feedback on that for just a few minutes each class that was spent on the project.","It was much more free-form, there was much less direction in terms of where to go with the analysis etc., and the expectations as far as the complexity of the analysis required were somewhat vague.",4,5,4,"I think having the high number of instructors present every week is totally awesome, so please don't change that! I think slightly more direction with the project, and perhaps more background on the actual statistics could be useful (even if it means more reading/work outside of class time)!","I enjoyed the interactive, do-it-in-real-time nature of the course, I loved that the instructors were grad students not profs so it felt less intimidating, and I loved that the course was small, so you kind of felt like you got to know the instructors a bit over the time.","Any other course I've taken or am currently taking ONLY worked in base R, whereas this course obviously taught in tidyR which I think is FAR superior, so that was super useful, thank you!!!","I did expect a bit more on simulating data and simulating models, but that wasn't a bit deal.",Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,Pacing was slightly fast at first (in Ahmed’s section) as there was a learning curve when first working with R. Content and concepts were all super useful for other classes! Challenges were a great way to make sure I’m still paying attention,3,5,Instructors were great! TAs were approachable and responded fast to emails and were always available for questions.,4,Maybe a bit more clarification with git. Would’ve preferred if TAs really encouraged using R throughout the project because we started using it and then it sort of faded into the background as we fell back to using Google Docs and sharing files through file transfer.,"It was a little hard to get right into it since the project was so broad, in comparison to other courses that are very specialized. However, once we decided on a topic (all of us were open to any ideas, which made it hard), we were able to dive right in and be productive.",5,5,4,Let students know when specific TAs are going to be in class or not since TAs all have different specialities and sometimes we need a specific question answered by a specific TA.,Understanding how to use R without copying code directly.,Everything R related!!! Other classes didn’t even teach me half of what I learned in the first class.,I would’ve enjoyed more modelling and making pretty graphs. Sometimes those topics were glossed over really quick.,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,5,"Reviewing concepts from statistics more thoroughly: especially knowing when to pick what test, checking assumptions, what kinds of statistics to report (confidence intervals, standard error, etc)",3,5,"The instructors were overall really knowledgeable and kind and open to questions, and I liked that they came from such different backgrounds of academia. They were great!",5,"I would have appreciated a better explanation of how to use github and command line git - it was covered really fast, and this is something I still have trouble with.","I loved that we had so much (guided) freedom to choose topics, work collaboratively during class time, and apply everything we learned in lectures. Unlike some other undergraduate group projects, this project felt very relevant and important and like we were actually making discoveries (I think the class time we received to work on the project made it different)",4,5,3,"More emphasis on stats (but I'm biased): during the final project, I saw lots of students making lots of violations to the assumptions of regression and it made my heart break",The assignments! They were the perfect synthesis of everything we learned,"Problem solving***, creativity, critical thinking, figuring things out independently, collaboration",Just more info about good practices of statistics,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-04,4,Lectures could be taken slower,3,4,Pacing,4,"There is a lot of effort involved in the various parts of the final, so I question the weighting of each section.","It was odd how... unstructured the assignment requirements were, yet how structured the group aspect was. I would prefer it the other way around.",5,4,4,Make sure the projector works lmao,Getting surprisingly good marks. I'm glad that everything was broken up into small assignments so that I could apply skills from each lecture. I also enjoyed that the final assignment allowed me to showcase other strengths other than skills in R and statistical analysis.,Using R,Not really - you guys hit everything quite well.,Yes,4
2018.0,2018-12-05,4,I thought it was really well thought out!,3,4,Instructors did a really good job!,5,I don't see anything to be improved upon.,"Aside from the coding, the concept behind the final project was pretty similar to other undergraduate group projects.",4,5,3,I think it's a really good course! Only thing to improve on is to have the class in a room that has properly functioning WiFi.,"Learning about all the graphs and plots that one can make in R, there's so many different ways to portray data!",Coding skills improved!,N/A,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-06,4,I think it's fine,3,4,It's fine,3,"Have more instructions on the final report, especially where to submit it","The datasets were less reliable, it is more difficult to figure out what we're doing.",4,5,5,N/A,The instructors understand students well and are very helpful.,Statistical analysis skill (especially on ANOVA); R programming skill,N/A,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-07,5,"If GitHub is going to be used, it is better to be taught earlier so by the time the projects started, they will have enough knowledge of Git.",2,5,GitHub assessment,4,not include GitHub,"The only difference is that we had now time to work in the project during class, something I really appreciate",4,5,5,"If GitHub is used, focus a little more on it, not just 1 lecture","Making graphs, as I did not use dplyr before, which was an easier method","R skills, statistical understanding.",No,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-07,5,"Challenges were great, helped make sure I was on track during the lecture.",3,5,Some instructors went a bit fast/taught more for an audience that was more familiar with programming/R in general and it would have been nice to slow down and do a bit more explaining.,5,no idea,having ample time in class to work on the final project.self assessment at the end/counting individual contributions as part of the final grade. normally there is no accountability for how much each member contributes.,5,5,3,Make sure there is a chance to work on at least 2 challenges per class,"Being able to easily get help from an instructor (stickies, having multiple instructors) during lecture.",… coding? I could not code before but I can code now,nah,Yes,5
2018.0,2018-12-07,4,"I think having more explanation for more challenging concepts would be useful. Maybe making the class more interactive would be beneficial, since sometimes it just felt that we were just copying down whatever code instructors were writing.",3,4,Explanation of concepts - especially stats ones since a lot of people hadn't been exposed to stats in at least a year.,4,More check ins - assign a TA to each group or so to ensure that all of our questions are being answered so we don't feel lost.,"There was definitely more structure in this project in terms of group dynamics (code of conduct, roles, meeting minutes). However I didn't particularly enjoy the open-endedness of the project itself. Usually my other projects involved a clear goal, but here we had to make it ourselves. I appreciate the experience, but it just was a little hard for me to adjust.",3,3,2,"Teach us how to use GitHub earlier!!! Also i think that it would be helpful for us to see all of the final project datasets at the start of the term, so we can start thinking about what we want to do earlier on, and as we learn skills through lectures we can apply them to our projects.","I really enjoyed the lecture material! It was delivered pretty well, and the lecture notes were a good reference as well.  R definitely is not as scary as I thought it was.",Logic. Being able to figure out what code had to be written to execute a task was a skill that I didn't have to do in any of my other courses.,N/A,Yes,4
